	lil timmy two shoes was playing with his java
    wow timmy just kept on playing away with that program
    The sagas of timmys adventures were crazy
    His also loved to drive his racecar around all day
    The racecar broke all the time though so timmy was sad
    No matter, the stats on the car were insane
    That little civic just couldn't keep up
    Nor could the kayak down the stream, timmy was too fast
    But "madam" timmy kept calling people as he flew by them, strange guy he was
    Timmy was on another level entirely
    Everyone he raced got redder by the second
    Although at noon, timmys adventures were over

problem 2:

    Endpoint: POST http://localhost:8080/usaaCodingChallenge/problem2

    Description: 
    Send the Postman response from problem 1 as the body of a POST request 
    to the problem 2 endpoint. This will give you the byte code in the service layer 
    for an encrypted image. You will need to use an XOR decryption algorithm to decrypt 
    the image file and return the decrypted bytes. The XOR encryption uses the
    value 1 to encrypt the image.
